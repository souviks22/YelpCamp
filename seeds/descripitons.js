    "Camp is an aesthetic style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad taste and ironic value. Camp aesthetics disrupt many of modernism's notions of what art is and what can be classified as high art by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.",
    "There is hardly any region in the Universe less accessible to human investigation than stellar interiors. For more than a decade, my work probed exactly that: the interiors of stars, vital regions of our Universe and the seed to human life. My research looked at the evolution of these enigmatic objects, their interactions with their nearby companions, and the nucleosynthesis processes taking place through their lifetimes.",
    "Unlike many astrophysicists who start marvelling at the mysteries of the cosmos from a very young age, I never thought Iâ€™d become one. In the small mountainous Lebanese village where I grew up, an urban legend has it that counting stars causes warts on your fingers. As any child would, I counted stars all the same but not without a creeping sense of thrill and apprehension of the curse that might befall me.",
    "All the beautiful things on planet earth- plants, animals, birds, mountains and rivers- are part of nature. The gifts of nature are indeed uncountable. It provides us with shelter, resources and much more. The beauty of nature fills our hearts with joy and peace. And most important of all, nature is what supports life. Forests give us air to breathe, while rivers and lakes give us water to drink.",
    "Despite being so important for our survival, we are destroying our biodiversity. As our population is rising, we are clearing lands to create houses and industries. Another major factor which is destroying our biodiversity are poaching and unsustainable hunting. We all can make a difference when it comes to protecting our biodiversity. We should use the sustainable products that are made without affecting the environment."
